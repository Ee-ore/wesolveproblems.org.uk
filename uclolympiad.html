      <h2>What are Maths Battles and Maths Circles?</h2>
<p>
A <a href="/maths-battle/"maths battle</a> is a competition between two opposing teams.  Children solve a given set of problems with their team first, 
and subsequently present their solutions in turns at the whiteboard to the scrutiny of the other team. You can find <a href="http://wesolveproblems.org.uk/maths-battle/simplified-rules.html">the rules for maths battles here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To perform better in “battles”, children are asked to attend regular training session, namely “maths circles”. 
This is done similar to sport competitions between schools, in which children are asked to attend training sessions in order 
to be able to represent their school.
</p>
<p>
While the “circles” form the backbone of our program, we rely on “battles” to generate interest and “buzz” around the curriculum.
