##Overview

On the 6th of November our first Maths battle took place. We were quite nervous. 
Maths Battles have been quite popular in many countries, but not yet in the UK. 
We asked ourselves: will the children enjoy it? Will it not be too difficult?

A Maths Battle is a competition between two teams of students, where each team 
presents their solutions to the opposition who challenge their answers. The idea is 
similar to that of a sports team, competing regularly and training in between the 
competitions. A team can win by solving more problems and presenting their 
solutions successfully.

##Preparing The First Maths Battle
    
Our very first Maths Battle took place at [the Royal Grammar School for boys in High Wycombe](http://www.rgshw.com/). Sixteen boys from years 8 to 10 took part. Prior to the Maths Battle we gave the trial questions to determine what the level was. Then we  gave the 
questions we were planning for the maths battle to our students from Brunel 
university to try. After the students had difficulty solving a particular question 
we replaced it with an easier one. We  were finally ready for battle.

## The First Phase - Solving The Problems
	 
At last on the 6th of November at 16:00, after school, we all met up in the maths 
department of RGS. We, the founders of the We Solve Problems foundation and a 
team of master students from Brunel University, conducted the tournament. We 
divided the 16 children into 4 teams of 4 and gave them 35 minutes to solve the 
problems. We worried if they could manage, but all turned out well.

## The Second Phase - Presenting The Solutions
	 
After the 35 minutes of preparation the Maths Battle began. The children quickly got 
the hang of the rules. Firstly, the captains of each team competed in a quick 
mathematical game to determine who would present their first problem. The 4 teams 
were put into 2 groups to compete against each other in separate rooms. The teams 
took turns in putting forward one of their participants to present a solution while 
the opposing team looked for mistakes and inaccuracies.

In both groups of teams, at least one had solved almost all if not all the problems. 
We were relieved that our guess for the difficulty level of the problems was just right. 
They were challenging but not impossible for the children.
    
At the end we saw many beaming faces, happy with what they had achieved. The idea of 
maths battling was something completely new to them, but it worked!

##Feedback

Here is some of their feedback:
    
> I think it is very social and it is better than classroom work

> I love it, the best maths fun ever

> I thoroughly enjoyed the Maths Battles

> I really do think Maths Battles is fun and it definitely helps my maths skills

> I like the Maths Battles concept, and the challenging problems

##Results
   	 
Were we right to be worried that this concept was too serious and difficult for 
children? No! The boys really loved it and the competitive edge motivated them to 
enjoy the more challenging problems. All of the boys said they wished to take part 
in yet another Maths Battle, so on the 7th of December we are organising another 
tournament in this school for these boys and newcomers!
