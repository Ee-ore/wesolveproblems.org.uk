title: Maths Battle 
shortsummary: A Maths Battle is a competition between two teams of students, where each team presents their solutions to the opposition who challenge their answers. The idea is similar to that of a sports team, competing regularly and training in between the competitions. A team can win by solving more problems and presenting their solutions successfully.
