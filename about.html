She was exposed to mathematical education in Russia since her teens, initially as a student of a specialized maths school in Moscow <a href="http://sch57.ru/index.en.html">( School 57)</a>, and later at the department of mathematics in Moscow State University. Elena did her PhD in Mathematics at the University of Amsterdam. At present she is a Research Fellow at <a href="http://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/elena-boguslavskaya">Brunel University London.</a></p>
                        <p>Elena is a big enthusiast of extra-curriculum mathematical education, such as maths circles and maths battles. She believes that mathematics is a language in the first place, and it is vital to be exposed to this language through various extra-curriculum activities at school. By promoting maths battles and maths circles she hopes to encourage mathematical creativity in children and help them to develop a skill in communicating mathematical ideas.</p>
