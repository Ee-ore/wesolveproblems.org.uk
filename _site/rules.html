        <h1>Maths Skirmish Rules</h1>
        <p>Maths Skirmish - competition between two teams in solving mathematical problems and presenting their solutions.</p>
      </div>


  <h2 id="general-provisions">General Provisions</h2>
<p>Maths Skirmish - competition between two teams in solving mathematical problems. First, the teams get the 
conditions of the problems and a particular time for their solution. While solving the problems the team 
may use any literature, but is not permitted to talk about the solution of these problems with anyone except 
for the members of the jury. At the end of the allotted time begins the actual battle, when teams tell each 
other the solutions of the problems in accordance with the given rules.</p>

<p>If one of the teams presents the solution, the other acts as an opponent, i.e. looking for mistakes (defects). 
The jury in points rates the speeches of the opponent and the speaker. If the teams have not solved the 
problem by the end and have not found any mistakes while discussing the proposed solution, the jury of the 
battle can take part of the score (or even all). The winner of the battle is the team that gets the most 
points in total. If, at the end of battle, team results do not differ by more than three points, it is 
considered that the battle ended in a draw. If, for some reason, the battle cannot end in a draw, the jury 
is to declare this to the teams before the battle and announce the procedure for determining the winner.</p>

<h2 id="the-general-scheme-of-the-battle">The General Scheme of the Battle</h2>
<p>The battle consists of several rounds. At the beginning of each round (if there is no rejection of the 
challenge - see para. “The End of the Battle”), one of the teams challenges the other for one of the problems, 
the solution of which has not yet been presented (for example: “We challenge the opponent team on problem number 8”). 
Then, the challenged team announces whether it accepts the challenge, i.e. whether it agrees to present the 
solution to this problem (it is given no more than one minute to make a decision on the challenge). If a team 
accepts the challenge, it nominates the speaker, who explains the solution, and the team who made the challenge 
nominates the opponent, whose duty is to look for errors in the presented solution. If the challenge is not 
accepted, then the team that made it is obliged to nominate the speaker, and the team that rejected the challenge 
has to nominate the opponent. In this case, they say that the checking of the reasonableness of the challenge is 
taking place.</p>

<h2 id="the-captains-competition">The Captain’s Competition</h2>
<p>The team that won the captain’s competition determines who will make the first challenge. It is held at the 
beginning of the battle. The captains are given a problem. The captain, who is first to inform the jury of his 
wish to answer, gets that right. If he presents the correct solution, he wins, and if incorrect – his rival wins. 
This is what is meant by “the correct solution”: simply the correct answer, the answer with an explanation, and 
so on - the jury specifies it before the competition of the captains.</p>

<p>The jury assigns a specific period of time for the solution of the problem for the captain’s competition. 
If, during this time, none of the captains expresses the desire to answer, the jury may replace the problem or 
determine the winner by draw. Instead of the problem the jury can offer to the captains to play in any game. 
There are other methods of carrying out the captain’s competition. The jury determines the way the captain’s 
competition will be held in advance and informs the teams before the beginning of the battle.</p>

<p>The team has the right to nominate any member of the team for the captain’s contest.</p>

<h2 id="the-progress-of-the-round">The Progress of the Round</h2>

<h3 id="report">Report</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the round, the speaker explains the solution at the blackboard. The report 
should contain answers to all the questions in the problem and proof of the accuracy and completeness of the 
received solutions. In particular, the speaker must prove each formulated interim statement or refer to it as 
already known. The speaker should try to insure that his presentation is clear, in particular, he must repeat 
any part of his report at the request of the opponent or the jury. The report time is limited to 15 minutes, 
after which the report can be continued only with the permission of the jury.</p>

<p>The speaker can use a paper with drawings and (with special permission of the jury) calculations, but is not 
permitted to bring with him the text of the solution.</p>

<p>The speaker has the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>put on the blackboard all necessary information before the presentation;</li>
  <li>not to answer the opponent’s questions raised before the beginning of the discussion;</li>
  <li>ask the opponent to clarify his question (in particular, the speaker may propose his own version of the question: “Do I understand correctly that you asked about something and something?”);</li>
  <li>refuse to answer the question, by saying that: 
    <ol>
      <li>he has no answer to this question; </li>
      <li>he has already answered this question (explaining when and how); </li>
      <li>the question is incorrect or beyond the scope of scientific discussion for the stated problem. In case the opponent disagrees with the basis of 2) and 3) the jury arbitrates the dispute.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The speaker is not obliged to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain how he/she worked out the solution if he can prove that it is correct and complete;</li>
  <li>compare his way of solving the problem with other possible methods, including in terms of brevity, beauty and aptitude for solving other problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="opposing">Opposing</h3>
<p>While the report is in progress, the opponent can ask questions only with the consent of the speaker, but he has 
the right to ask for any part of the solution to be repeated. He can allow the speaker not to prove any obvious 
(from his perspective) facts. After the end of the report, the opponent has the right to ask the speaker questions. 
If the opponent does not ask a single question within a minute, it is considered that he has no questions. 
If the speaker does not begin to answer a question within a minute, it is considered that he has no answer.</p>

<p>As a question, the opponent can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demand that any part of the report is repeated;</li>
  <li>ask for a clarification of any of the speaker’s statements, including: 
    <ol>
      <li>asking for a definition of any term (“What do you mean by …”); </li>
      <li>reformulating the speaker’s statement in his own words and asking for confirmation (“Do I understand correctly that you are stating the following: …”);</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>ask the speaker to prove the statement posed by him, if it is not obvious or well-known (in the case of a dispute, the jury is to decide whether the question is known or apparent; in any case, as known is considering the facts, included in the general educational program in mathematics);</li>
  <li>express satisfaction or explain his motivated dissatisfaction with it after receiving the answer to the question.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the opponent thinks that the speaker is stalling for time, coming up with a solution at the blackboard, or 
that a significant part of the report does not contain the solution of the problem under discussion, he has the 
right (but no earlier than 10 minutes after the beginning of the report) to ask the speaker to submit a solution 
(if it is implied in the problem) or an outline of the remaining argument.</p>

<p>The speaker and the opponent must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>express themselves in a polite and proper manner, </li>
  <li>not “get personal” while criticizing each other’s statements;</li>
  <li>repeat and refine their questions and answers at the request of each other or of the jury.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the results of the report and responses to the questions, the opponent has the right to give his 
assessment of the report and the discussion in one of the following ways: </p>

<ol>
  <li>recognize that the solution is correct; </li>
  <li>recognize the solution (response) as basically correct, but having drawbacks and/or gaps which he has to identify; </li>
  <li>recognize the solution (response) as incorrect, pointing out the mistakes in the proven key assertions of the report, or by providing a contrary example, or by specifying the significant gaps in the argument’s or solution’s construction. If the opponent has agreed with the solution, he and his team are no longer involved in this round.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the opponent has a contrary example refuting the solution of the speaker in general, and this contrary example is 
a solution to the problem itself (this happens, for example, in cases where the question of the problem sounds like 
“Can you …?”, “Is it true that …?” and so on), the opponent has the right to declare: “I do not agree with the 
solution, I have a contrary example”, but not to show the contrary example to the speaker yet (the jury is entitled 
to require submission of a contrary example in writing to ensure the correctness of the opponent’s statement). 
In this case, if the speaker does not change his solution within a minute, or after the break that was taken by the team, 
the opponent is entitled to present the contrary example mentioned to the speaker; in which case the speaker and 
his team no longer have the authority to change the solution or response.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the solution requires an executive search, the opponent has the right to say, 
“I do not agree with the decision, not all cases were considered”, without specifying to the speaker exactly what 
case was not considered. The further actions of the speaker, the jury and the opponent are the same as in the 
situation with a contrary example.</p>

<h3 id="participation-of-the-jury-in-the-discussion">Participation of the jury in the discussion</h3>
<p>After the end of the dialogue of the speaker and the opponent, the jury asks its questions. If necessary, it has the 
right to intervene before, and during the dialogue of the speaker and the opponent.</p>

<h3 id="speakers-and-the-team">Speakers and the team</h3>
<p>The speaker and the opponent can go to their captains with a request for a replacement or for 
a break for consultation. Other communication between the team and the speaker (opponent) shall be permitted only 
during a half a minute break, which can be taken by any team at any time (in this case the rivals can also use this time). 
Each team is allowed to take no more than six half a minute breaks during each battle (see para. “Number of the Appearances at the Blackboard”).</p>

<h3 id="role-reversal">Role reversal</h3>
<p>The role reversal in the round can only happen if the challenge in this round was accepted. If the opponent has proven 
that the speaker has no solution (the jury decides if it is so, see para. “Scoring”) the opponent is entitled (but not obliged) 
to present his solution. If the opponent made the decision to present his solution, then there is a complete change of roles, 
that is, the former speaker becomes an opponent. If the opponent did not prove that the speaker has no solution, but found in 
the proposed solution some specific drawbacks, he is entitled (but not obliged) to dispose of all (or some) of these 
drawbacks (“patch holes”). The same right the opponent gets if he proved that the speaker has no solution, but refused 
to present his own solution. If the opponent decides to “patch holes”, then a partial change of roles appears: the opponent 
states exactly what he is going to do (for example, analyze the case, which was not inquired into by the speaker; prove the 
statement unproven by the speaker and so on), and the former speaker opposes him.</p>

<p>The inverse reversal of roles does not happen in any case!</p>

<h3 id="the-correctness-of-the-challenge">The correctness of the challenge</h3>
<p>If the challenge is accepted, then the question of its correctness is not considered, 
that is, the received challenge is always considered to be correct!</p>

<p>If the challenge is not accepted, then there are two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>if the team that made the challenge also refuse to answer, then the challenge is “automatically” deemed invalid;</li>
  <li>if the team that made the challenge nominated the speaker, then the correctness of the challenge depends on the further course of the round, namely, the challenge deemed incorrect if the opponent managed to prove that the problem is not solved. In case the opponent declares the problem solved, the challenge is “automatically” accepted as correct!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="number-of-the-appearances-at-the-blackboard">Number of the Appearances at the Blackboard</h2>
<p>Each member of the team has the right to go to the blackboard as a speaker or an opponent no more than two times per battle. 
The team is entitled to replace the speaker or an opponent no more than three times per battle, and in each case, the 
appearances are counted for both team members. At each replacement, the time allotted to the team breaks reduces by one 
minute (this minute can be used directly before the replacement, or it can be not used. In the latter case, the 
opponent’s team is also not allowed to use it).</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge-procedure-end-of-the-battle">The Challenge Procedure. End of the Battle</h2>
<p>If the challenge has been recognized as invalid, the team has to repeat the challenge in the next round. In all other 
cases, the teams challenge each other in turn.
At any time during the battle the team that should make a challenge may refuse to do so (it usually happens when the team 
has no more solved problems, and it is risky to make a challenge, which may be flawed). Then, the other team gets the right 
(but not the obligation) to present the solution to the remaining problems. In this case the team which refused to make a 
challenge can nominate the opponents and earn points just for opposing, but has no right to present the solutions (i.e., 
after the rejection of the challenge neither full, nor partial change of roles can occur). The battle ends when all the 
problems are discussed, or when one of the teams refuses the challenge and the other team refuses to present the solution 
of the remaining problems.</p>

<h2 id="earning-points">Earning Points</h2>
<p>Each problem is worth 12 points, which are distributed between the speaker, the opponent and the jury by the end of the round. 
If the speaker presents the correct and complete solution, he gets all 12 points. If the opponent was able to find significant 
errors in the solution, the jury primarily decides the question of whether the opponent was able to prove that the speaker does 
not solve the problem. If the opponent has failed to do so, he can nevertheless get the points for opposing, depending on the 
seriousness of the defects and how the speaker (or an opponent if there was a partial change of roles) managed to fix them. 
Generally, the opponent receives the half of the “cost” of the “holes” that were not “patched” by the speaker in the solution 
(the principle of “half”), but if the speaker was able to present a complete solution only after a considerable probing questions 
from the opponent and/or the jury (“mud” in solution), the jury can take away no more than two points from the speaker and 
transfer it to the opponent, or leave it for themselves. If there was a partial change of roles, the former opponent gets extra 
points for proving the statements that were formulated prior, and the former speaker - for their opposition (at that the “cost” 
of the concerned statements is defining by the jury, and the distribution of the points is happening the same way, as when 
opposing a complete solution - taking into account the principle of “half” and “dirt” in the debates). The remaining points 
are distributed between the speaker and the jury, and the round ends. If the opponent failed to prove that the speaker has no 
solution, he gets points for opposing (taking into account the principle of “half”) and, if the challenge was received, the 
right to present his solution (see para. “Role reversal”). If this is accompanied by a complete or partial change of roles, 
then scoring occurs according to the method described above.</p>

<p>If the errors or gaps in the report are pointed out by the speaker himself and are not disposed of by his team, the opponent 
gets points for them as if he had found these drawbacks himself. In particular, if, having been refused a challenge, the 
captain of the challenging team immediately recognizes that his team does not have a solution, the opponent’s team gets 6 
points for opposing (which in this case consists of a single sentence: “You have no solution”), and the challenge accepted 
as incorrect. In this case, the speaker and the opponent are not nominated and the appearances at the blackboard are not counted.</p>

<h2 id="the-captain">The Captain</h2>
<p>During the battle, only the captain can speak to the jury and contestants on behalf of the team: to report of a challenge or 
refusal, to request a break, and so on. He has the right to stop the presentation or the opposing of the representative of 
his team at any time. If the captain is at the blackboard, he nominates the deputy, who performs the duties of the captain 
at this time. The names of the captain and the deputy are reported to the jury before the beginning of the battle.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility of the captain during the solution of the problems is to coordinate the actions of the team members 
to solve as many problems as possible. To do so, the captain distributes the problems to solve according to the wishes of the 
members of the team, ensuring that every problem has been solved by someone and organizes the checking of the solutions. The 
captain determines in advance, who will be the speaker or the opponent on a given problem and determines the tactics of the 
team for the upcoming battle.</p>

<p>The captains of the teams have the right to ask the jury to provide 5-10 minutes breaks during the battle (approximately every 
half hour). The break may be provided only between rounds. The team, which is to make a challenge, does so in writing (without 
an announcement) immediately before the break and hands it to the jury, which announces the challenge immediately after the break.</p>

<h2 id="the-jury">The Jury</h2>
<p>The jury is the supreme interpreter of the rules of the battle. In situations, which are not covered by the rules, it shall 
decide at its own discretion. The teams are bound by the jury’s decisions.</p>

<p>While the teams are solving the problems, every significant clarification of the problem that was given by one of the teams 
should be reported as soon as possible to all other teams.</p>

<p>The jury may withdraw the question of the opponent (for example, if it has no merit), or stop the report or opposition if they 
are taking too long. If the jury cannot gain an understanding of the solution quickly, it may, with the approval of both captains, 
allocate its representative, who will continue to discuss the problem in cooperation with the speaker and the opponent in another 
room. The battle continues on other problems, and the points for this problem are awarded later.</p>

<p>The jury writes the battle protocol on the blackboard. If one of the teams does not agree with the decision made by the jury 
regarding the problem, it has the right to immediately demand a break for a few minutes to discuss the situation with the 
participation of the chairman of the jury. After the beginning of the next round, the score of the previous round cannot be changed.</p>

<p>The jury keeps order. It can fine the team for noise, inappropriate behavior, or communication with their representative who 
is located at the blackboard.</p>

<p>The jury is obliged to give reasons for all of its decisions that do not follow directly from the rules of the battle.</p>
