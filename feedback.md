##Teachers

> Pupils at the RGS have really enjoyed maths battles and numbers grow week on week.
> The problems are fun and open questions give the boys further opportunity to work
> collaboratively outside of the classroom as well as potentially considering mathematics
> from a different perspective. It is defiantly something the boys look forward
> to on a Monday evening, the battles even more so.

Mr. Jamie A. Rizk, Maths Teacher, The Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe

##Students

> I like the Maths Battles concept, and the challenging problems. The Maths Circles are a little repetitive; maybe two ideas per session would be more interesting. Maths Battles however are perfectly fine, and offer a great opportunity to us to give Maths Problems complex solutions.

> I think it is very social and it is better than classroom work because of face-to-face conversation with more relaxed people.

> I really do think Maths Battles is fun and it definitely helps my maths skills especially later maths when it gets a lot harder. Also I think that this will help me with my explanations and my confidence in speaking to the class and this will be very important in later life.

> It is fun to discuss, but many of the problems are very difficult.

> I loved it, and the snacks were great! I would love to come again, and I wish to increase my skills. It was a great way to learn different ways to do things, from people my age and above, and seeing the solution that someone else got for a question is quite satisfying, and teaches a lot.

> The Maths Battle was an enjoyable experience due to the difficulty of the problems however some of the problems could be clearer as several loopholes could be found in them. I would like to participate in this opportunity again.

***

> The face to face conversation helped me understand better and I like the idea of extending your knowledge by relating to the targets of the session. Also I think it would be useful to see the solutions after solving.

> I think that with more people, conversations are longer and more detailed, and more time to do work and focus individually [would improve the experience]. I love it, the best maths fun ever. So lucky to be here, challenging but fun.
