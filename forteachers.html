On this page you will find information that will help you to organize Maths Balltes and Maths Circle in your school.

      <h2>What is difference between Maths Battles and Maths Circles?</h2>
<p>
A maths battle is a competition between two opposing teams.  Children solve a given set of problems with their team first, and subsequently present their solutions in turns at the whiteboard to the scrutiny of the other team. You can find the rules for maths battles at 
http://wesolveproblems.org.uk/maths-battle/simplified-rules.html
</p>
<p>
To perform better in “battles”, children are asked to attend regular training session, namely “maths circles”. This is done similar to sport competitions between schools, in which children are asked to attend training sessions in order to be able to represent their school.
</p>
<p>
While the “circles” form the backbone of our program, we rely on “battles” to generate interest and “buzz” around the curriculum.

      <h2>What is the curriculum?</h2>
<p>
Maths cirlces explore a number of topics from the problem-solving art, such as elementary mathematical logic, induction, pigeonhole principle, etc.  At the beginning of each session a particular mathematical concept is introduced by the instructor through examples.
</p>
<p>
You can find some of our problems at http://wesolveproblems.org.uk/problems/. We train for general problem-solving skills as well as the ability to present one’s results clearly and coherently. The topics do not rely on each other in general, and it is possible for children to resume their participation after missing several sessions.

      <h2>What is the target age of children for maths battles?</h2>
<p>
We aim to work with secondary school children from the age of 11.  At the moment we divide children according to their year group:  Year 7-8, and Year 9-10.  We found that the younger children are the most enthusiastic, and we are working hard to preserve their interest in maths when they grow older.

      <h2>How are maths circles conducted?</h2>
<p>
The maths circles are run through one-to-one conversations with instructors. After a concept is introduced at the beginning of a session, the children are asked to try to solve a given set of problems. When a child thinks they mastered a problem, they raise a hand and an instructor comes by to talk. The primary aim of maths circles is to teach children how to articulate mathematical ideas. For a class of 20 children 4-5 instructors are typically present.
